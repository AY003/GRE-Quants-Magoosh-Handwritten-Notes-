Chapter Wise, I'll be going through each videos and will be making notes alongside, 
and will upload as if when I finish each chapter. 
As Magoosh videos are very comprehensive in itself, as they give all fundamental concepts which are used in GRE quants 
(or in general in mathematical reasoning for other similar exam) coupled with examples.

(I'll put #side notes also in the notes for chapter that uses concepts of other chapters)
If there are any disperancies in the notes or if any particular page is not visible properly in the pdf, 
feel free to mail at olohello52@gmail.com, I'll reupload it again.

and after I give my GRE on 6th Nov 2020 one can mail in case you are not able to understand a particular topic from these notes 
or stuck in a GRE quants question, I'll be happy to answer your queries in way: 
1) In which you understand that particular problem solution.
2) Underlying fundamental concept that you were missing from that chapter.(will put the refrence of page no from the notes that one can refer) 
3) Will give you a bonus similar example question related to it, to solidify the understand of the concept.
